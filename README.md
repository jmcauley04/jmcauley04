# Recent Projects

### Canopy API Integration
Canopy is an external vendor that provides our business electronic media (images of products) to be used in our applications. Tasked with creating a proof of concept to show the functionality of their API and then to introduce it to our developers, I created a fluent interface class library as a mediator to convert Canopy domain knowledge to our business domain knowledge allowing our developers to use strongly typed and familiar properties to interact with the API.

### Kubernetes on Rancher
Our business began an initiative to containerize our new applications in a Linux OS and I volunteered to help define this process. First, locally, I resolved various issues with Windows dependencies (IBM’s DB DLL, Windows Auth, etc.). In the end, I created a pipeline in Azure Devops that utilizes the project’s dockerfile to build and deploys to our Rancher environment using YAML configured environment variables, clusterIPs for pod-to-pod communication, and ingress.
